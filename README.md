# Genetics Toolbox

The goal of this project is to create several web apps that can perform common calculations or tasks in genetics.

### Genetic Code Tool
This web app provides several functions relating to DNA template and coding strands:
* Finding complementary strands
* Transcribing into RNA
* Determining the open reading frame (ORF)
* Translating into amino acid sequences

### Future Ideas
I plan to develop tools for:
* Hardy-Weinberg calculations
* Three-point-cross gene mapping
* Other suggestions are welcome!
