# Genetics Toolbox

The goal of this project is to create several tools that can perform common calculations or tasks relating to genetics.

Checkout the [app](http://geneticstoolbox.azurewebsites.net/) hosted on Azure.

### Genetic Code Tool
This tool provides several functions relating to DNA template and coding strands:
* Finding complementary strands
* Transcribing into RNA
* Determining the open reading frame (ORF)
* Translating into amino acid sequences

### Hardy-Weinberg Tool
The Hardy-Weinberg law is used to predict genotype and allele frequencies in a gene pool under an ideal condition called the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Using the Wolfram|Alpha Instant Calculator API, this tool will take in any genotype or allele frequencies and will return a set of information about the specified gene pool.

### Future Ideas
I plan to develop tools for:
* Three-point-cross gene mapping
* ...Other suggestions are welcome!
